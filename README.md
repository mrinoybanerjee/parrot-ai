Parrot-AI is an AI-enabled language learning application designed to facilitate interactive conversation and debate practice in multiple languages.

## Features
- **Language Practice**: Supports English, Hindi, German, Spanish, and French.
- **Learning Modes**: Choose between Conversation and Debate modes.
- **Proficiency Levels**: Tailored for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced learners.
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create custom scenarios and roles for practice.

## Motivation
Through my travels, I realized the importance of language to establish deep connections with locals. However, apps like Duolingo haven‚Äôt been fitting my learning style. I learn best when I can immerse myself into conversations and pick up ideas.

## Goal
To leverage the power of LLMs for language learning, I will develop an AI-enabled language learning app. This app will enable learners to observe and learn from two AI chatbots engaged in any user-defined conversations or debates, providing an interactive environment to enhance language acquisition.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React
- **Language Models**: OpenAI's GPT-3.5 via LangChain
